An Objective-C binding to OpenAL. Written for use on the iPhone, but should also work on OSX. Just drop in your project and include the following frameworks:

  CoreAudio
  AudioToolbox
  AVFoundation
  OpenAL

Threw this together for a small iPhone game I was working on. It seems to work, but is pretty basic. Patches appreciated.
